# FlyBack: API-Driven Flight Search with Object-Oriented Design

## Goal
FlyBack is an early prototype towards the implementation of a comprehensive application that helps foreign students and workers find the best travel solutions to return to their home country.

Using data regarding available airline flights, obtained with the use of APIs, and leveraging the concepts of object-oriented programming and sorting algorithms FlyBack is a working program that allows users to perform two different types of searches that enable them to satisfy different needs that foreign students and workers might have when trying to return to their home country.
## Highlights
- **Real Flight Data Collection**: Use of Amadeus API to collect real-time data on available flights.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Designed the system with a OOP architecture to manage user search queries and flight data.
- **Flight Sorting Algorithm**: Implemented the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort flights by price.

## Introduction
One of the greatest challenges faced by foreign workers and students is the need to balance professional and academic commitments with the desire to visit their families and return home.

Planning to return to one's hometown can be hampered by budget constraints and limited time and day availability and thus can result in a time-consuming activity. These needs on the part of workers and students are tried to be met by traditional flight search engines, which, however, are intended for other types of users.

In fact, these search engines are designed to offer more generic filters and solutions, which are ideal for a person trying to organize a real vacation. They are therefore not suited to meet the specific needs of someone who lives away from home and faces specific constraints in deciding when to return.

The vast majority of flight search engines are intended for the mass market, which forces users with specific needs to manually compare different flights to find the most suitable one, resulting in a large expenditure of time.

Existing platforms are not sufficient to meet the needs of students and workers away from home.

FlyBack, the project presented in this paper, is a first step toward building a customized solution capable of meeting the needs of workers and students away from home. The goal of FlyBack is to facilitate the search for solutions that can meet the specific price and time requirements stated by its users.
